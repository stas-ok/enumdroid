## Description ##

This application adds ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping) support to your Android phone.

Each time you dial a full international number (i.e. starting with a '+') your phone will check the DNS for additional routing	information and offer you a list of alternate contact methods.

This application has been developed by [Nominet UK](http://www.nominet.org.uk/).  Nominet is the Tier 1 ENUM operator for the UK (+44).

**NB**: unless you are a software developer it is recommended that you install the application via the Google Market (under Applications -> Communication) so that you are automatically informed when updates are made available.
